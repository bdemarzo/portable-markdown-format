description: Draft, revise, or update the implementation-ready engineering plan as the Software Architect operator before plan-review. Use when turning an approved spec into `./docs/workflows/{slug}/plan.md`, updating an existing plan, or incorporating accepted plan-review feedback before implementation.

# Plan Create

Use this skill as the `Software Architect` operator playbook.

The operator owns drafting and updating `./docs/workflows/{slug}/plan.md`.

Use [assets/template.md](./assets/template.md) as the default output skeleton when creating a new artifact. Adapt sections as needed, but preserve the slugged title format.

Requirements:
- derive `slug` from the workflow dossier or source spec
- update the existing plan in the dossier instead of creating duplicates
- preserve the dossier slug unless the workflow intentionally splits into a new dossier
- start the artifact with the exact H1 `# Plan - {slug}`
- link to the source spec artifact path in the plan body
- keep the plan self-contained enough that a later engineer can resume from the plan plus the repository without needing `run.md`
- make clear near the top what changes for the user or system and how successful delivery will be observed
- keep the permanent artifact concise and skimmable by default
- treat `./docs/workflows/{slug}/plan.md` as the authoritative execution plan for the workflow
- repo-local `PLANS.md` may be read as optional project context, but it must not replace this workflow's plan structure, stage contract, or execution control unless the user explicitly asks for repo-native planning mode
- treat the plan as a living current-state document, not an implementation journal
- keep implementation decisions current; once implementation starts, detailed step evidence belongs in `execution.md`
- define non-obvious terms in plain language instead of assuming prior repo knowledge
- when revising after `plan-review`, incorporate accepted review outcomes into `plan.md`
- when the plan is ready for execution, mark that state clearly in the plan body

Operator responsibility:
- draft the source artifact for later review
- do not try to review or approve your own work
- leave material objections for `plan-review`

Plan boundary:
- use the spec to define what must be true for users
- use the plan to define engineering decisions, sequencing, interfaces, validation, idempotence, and recovery
- use `execution.md` for checks run, changed areas, remediation history, and deviations during multi-step implementation
- send user-visible behavior, privacy, correctness, or scope gaps back to `spec-create`

Decision rule:
- if a missing detail affects user-visible behavior, privacy, or correctness, stop and send it back to the spec
- if a missing detail is only needed for implementation, decide it in the plan
- if the plan would introduce a new architectural direction, major architectural constraint, or a new third-party service, SDK, hosted platform, or external tool, treat that as materially important and route it back through the orchestrator for clarification or approval when needed
- when unsure, do not backfill product discovery into the plan; push unclear user-facing contract questions back to the spec

Architecture standard:
- prefer the simplest plan that can credibly satisfy the approved spec
- reuse existing repository patterns, abstractions, and infrastructure before introducing new ones
- justify each non-trivial layer, service, dependency, job, external tool, or abstraction in present-tense terms
- cut any proposed component that cannot be justified by the current spec
- do not add speculative extensibility, future-proofing layers, or optional platformization unless the current spec clearly requires them

Style rule:
- focus on decisions, sequencing, interfaces, validation, and recovery
- prefer compact bullets or short prose blocks over long explanatory narrative
- avoid restating the same intent, dependency, or risk in multiple sections unless the repetition materially improves implementation safety
- make design tradeoffs legible with the shortest explanation that still justifies the choice
- prefer one recommended approach over broad option catalogs unless the decision is still intentionally open

Require these expectations:
- the plan must be restartable from `plan.md` plus the repository alone
- treat restartability as a hard requirement
- `Implementation Decisions`, `Current Plan`, `Validation and Acceptance`, and `Idempotence And Recovery` are mandatory current-state sections
- validation should include concrete commands or checks with expected observable outcomes when the project permits them
- accepted review outcomes must be incorporated into the plan before implementation begins
- do not append a long implementation journal to the plan; summarize progress and point to `execution.md`

Do not:
- restate product policy unless the spec is ambiguous
- mix in brainstorming
- begin implementation
- silently repair product-contract gaps that should have been clarified in the spec
- expand straightforward decisions into essay-style rationale unless the tradeoff is non-obvious or high risk
- introduce architecture that is primarily justified by hypothetical future needs
- duplicate the same control point across multiple layers unless the redundancy is intentional and clearly justified
- repeat spec acceptance criteria only when the repetition materially reduces implementation risk

The output of this stage should be ready for `plan-review`.
